> Built an app in R that lets me easily analyze any dataset using regression analysis and gain valuable insights. Whether it's a small or large dataset, I can upload an external file and select my dependent and independent variables. The app also generates graphs that help to visualize the relationships between variables, making the analysis even more insightful.
